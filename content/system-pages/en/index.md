THANADOS (The Anthropological and Archaeological Database of Sepultures) deals with the digital
collection and presentation of Early Medieval cemeteries in the area of present day Austria.

Within THANADOS hitherto published information on Early Medieval burials was digitized and
translated to English language. The data are mapped using the CIDOC CRM and provided online. The
information can be explored via a digital catalogue and within an interactive map. Cartographic
visualisations as well as charts and plots are created dynamically based on real archaeological
research data.

It aims at providing a best practice way on how to disseminate archaeological sources and research
in the 21st century against the background of digital humanities.
