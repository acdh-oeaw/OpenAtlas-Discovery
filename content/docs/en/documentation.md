Welcome to the detailed admin area documentation. Here you can find everything you need to know on
how to customize your OpenAtlas-Discovery presentation-website!

**Important note:** Don't forget to always "**Publish**" your changes. They will be visible on your
presentation site in a few minutes.

The admin area is divided by so named **Collections**. The **Collections** are:

- Config
- Metadata
- System Pages
- Pages
- Team

In the following, we will discuss every single one and what you can do with it.

## Config

The **Config**-Collection beholds the overall _Project Config_. Here you can :

- edit the _colors_ of the website (the main brand color and the geojson color, which is for the
  entities locations on the map)
- _select a default language_ for the website (if it is availiable in more languages)
- upload your project's _logo_ - here is prefered to provide logo's for the light and dark mode of
  the website and a logo with and without text. (of course you can also just upload the same logo in
  all the categories :wink:)
- add an _imprint_ to your website (if you are an acdh-ch-oeaw cooperation partner, don't hesitate
  to use the acdh-ch-imprint, otherwise you can add your
  [own imprint page](#creating-a-custom-imprint-page))
- add your project's _twitter_-account to provide metadata to web-crawlers (more exposure, hooray!)

## Metadata

The **Metadata**-Collection beholds the _Project Metadata_. Here you must provide

- your project's title
- your project's short title
- your project's description.

This serves as metadata for web-crawlers, so your website ranks better in Google search results.
(again, more exposure for your project! :thumbsup:)

## System Pages

The **System Pages**-Collection beholds the

- Landing page / index page of your website. - It is called like your project (default:
  _OpenAtlasDiscovery_)
- The _Team_ page

In the _index_ page file (and _Team_ page file) you can

- provide a _title_ (it will be the heading for the page and will also show up in the URL)
- add a _navigation_ title (it will be shown in the website header)
- upload an _hero image_ (e.g. a logo for dark and light mode, or on the _Team_ page a photo of your
  team.)
- add an _hero lead-in_ text (will be shown underneath the hero image, e.g. the description of your
  project)
- add main _links_ to important other pages on your website (they will be rendered as buttons, e.g.
  data and map)
- provide extra _content_ for the page

## Pages

In the **Pages**-Collection you can manage your own content-pages. The link to your created pages,
will show up in the header on the presentation-site. By default there is a "About the project"-page.

Again for creating a new page, you need to specify:

- a _title_ (it will be the heading for the page and will also show up in the URL)
- a _navigation title_ (it will be shown in the website header)
- and of course the _content_ of the page.

### Creating a custom imprint page

If you want to create your custom imprint page, you need to

- set the _imprint_ setting to _use custom imprint page_ in the project config
- create a page with the _title_ "**Imprint**" in the **Pages**-Collection. This is mandatory, it
  must be spelled like this! (without the quotation marks, of course) Here you can then specify the
  content for the custom imprint page.

## Team

In the **Team**-Collection you can add new team members, they will be displayed as a list under your
content in the **System Pages**-Collection / _Team_ page

When creating a new team member you can

- provide the _First name_ of the member
- provide the _Last name_ of the member (this is mandatory, though!)
- provide the academic title of the member
- upload an photo (it will be displayed in a profile picture style / circle)
- add a short biography of the member
