# FemCareVienna

The FemCareVienna project (FWF individual grant P 36459-G) aims to elucidate
the history of medical care for woman through an interdisciplinary study of
the historical and bioarchaeological record pertaining to the Hospital of the
Elisabethians in Vienna. Central to the project are the life histories of 390
patients from the 18th century whose skeletal human remains were excavated
from the hospital cemetery.
